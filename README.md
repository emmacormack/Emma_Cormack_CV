## Work Experience
**Glasgow Eco Trust | June 2025 - August 2025 | Business Data Analysis Intern | Glasgow**
- Glasgow Eco Trust is a small charity based in West Glasgow delivering a range of environmental activities and services.  My role, facilitated by the University of Glasgow’s Find a Solution programme included organising and analysing data from across the organisation, in particular their bike workshop. This primarily involved Google Sheets analysis and presentation using Canva. Functions included joining, cleaning, and analysing data using pivot tables. In addition, I reviewed customer relationship management systems for future implementation in the charity. 
- My experience at Glasgow Eco Trust largely built upon my data analysis skills in Google Sheets as well as data presentation. In Canva, I designed intuitive and creative presentations to illustrate findings. The charity described how my analysis highlights their progress and will inform future decision-making.

**The Health and Social Care ALLIANCE Scotland | June 2024 - August 2024 | Volunteer - Policy and Research | Glasgow**
- The ALLIANCE is a health and social care intermediary, representing the third sector. As a volunteer in the policy and research department, I aided in their consultation responses to the government, the staff weekly bulletin, parliamentary monitoring and staff meetings. I also had the opportunity to attend a committee meeting at the Scottish Parliament, and undergo training in GIRFEC. I practiced relaying social and public policy news in simple terms for the bulletin, building upon my communication skills. Additionally, I was trained in researching policy in a timely and efficient manner, and documenting this as part of parliamentary monitoring.
- This experience built upon my interests in public health and policy. As well as developing skills in communication and research, I became accustomed to working professionally within Microsoft Office applications such as Excel, Teams, and Outlook. 

**British Council | October 2022 - February 2023 | Language Assistant | Córdoba, Spain**
- With the British Council I spent five months in the South of Spain as an English language assistant, working in a primary school. This was my introduction to the professional workplace and where I honed my skills working with children. It was also an opportunity to improve my Spanish language skills. I became proficient in leading class lessons and lesson plans. Additionally, my time living abroad improved my confidence and sense of independence.

**Italki | December 2021 - January 2023 | Freelance English Tutor | Online**
- Through Italki’s online platform I taught English to students worldwide, from age seven and above. While this improved my teaching skills, the experience allowed me to hone the skill of conversing with people from all ages and cultures.

**Self Employed Music Tuition | October 2017 - March 2020 | Piano and Violin Tutor | Home**
- Teaching violin and piano to children has been one of my most rewarding achievements. Throughout three years I taught nine pupils of different ages and some were able to complete formal examinations under my supervision. Teaching vastly improved my social skills, as well as organisation and problem solving. I became proficient at liaising with parents and of course making fun and interesting lessons for the children.
